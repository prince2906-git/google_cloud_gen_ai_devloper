### What is an AI models ?
    An AI model is a program that uses data to recognize patterns and make decisions. 
    AI models can be used for many tasks, including image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. 

### How do AI models work? 
    >> AI models are trained on data sets using algorithms.
    >> Once trained, the model can make predictions or take actions based on new data.
    >> AI models can be used to perform tasks without further human intervention.
    
### Types of AI Models
    **Supervised learning:** A neural network uses labeled data sets to make predictions or decisions
    **Unsupervised learning**: A type of AI model that learns from data without labels
    **Reinforcement learning**: An AI model that uses algorithms, data, and computing power to learn and improve
    **Neural networks:** A popular AI model that's similar to the human brain, with layers and connections called artificial neurons
                     Used for speech recognition, image understanding, and language understanding.
    **Decision trees:** An AI model that uses a tree-like approach to narrow down answers based on questions
    **Deep learning:** An AI model that can automate complex tasks, such as transcribing sound into text or describing images
                        **Large language models (LLMs)** are pre-trained deep learning models.
    **Generative AI:** An AI model that can create content, such as text, images, audio, and synthetic data
    **Natural language processing (NLP):** A branch of AI that allows computers to understand, generate, and manipulate human language.

### Predictive AI 
    Used to make predictions or classification based on input data.
    e.g. An animal image has been provided to model and based on its training it has to predict
         weather it is a cat or not ?
    ML or Predictive AI are the most classical models, which are trained on historical data to classify or make prediction on similar data.


### Generative AI
    It creates new data based on patterns it has learned from training data.
    Training data is general and not specific to a particular task. 
    Training Dataset : Several Format of Unlabled Data, images, text or audio.
    At Pre-training stage large general datasets are used. Later smaller and more specific datasets are used to fine tune the model.
    Once the model is trained, it can generate a new unique data that is not seen before.

### Unlabeled Data and Its Examples
    Unlabeled data is raw data that doesn't have any labels or tags. It's often used in machine learning and AI to uncover patterns without human intervention. 
    Examples of unlabeled data: 
        A list of emails without spam or non-spam tags
        A set of images without tags for people, cars, or animals
        Photo images
        Audio and video recordings

        Tweets
        Medical scans

### Uses of unlabeled data
        > Unlabeled data is often used in unsupervised learning, which is a type of machine learning that analyzes data sets without human intervention. 
        > Unlabeled data is also used in tasks like plan recognition, where the data may not be immediately compatible with predefined action streams. 

### How to create labeled data
        Humans are asked to make judgments about a piece of unlabeled data to create a label. For example, they might look at a picture and decide if it's a picture of a cat or a dog. 

### Benefits of unlabeled data
        Unlabeled data can be very effective for machine learning, especially when exploration is the primary goal.
