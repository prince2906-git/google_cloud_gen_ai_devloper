Google Cloud offers AI tools and infrastructure to help businesses build AI-powered applications and services.
Google Cloud's AI capabilities include:

### Built in Data Governance
    You need to gurantee that no one can see the questions user asking or training data that provides your unique, competitive advantages.
    e.g. Highly Regulated Inudtsries :
            Financial Services
            Healthcare.

### Match Cost Value
    Google Cloud doesn't believe that one model fits all. Infact bigger is not better specially from a cost of infernece perspective.
    e.g. Large 300 Billion parameter models can cost as much as $1000 per user, per year to run, which adds uptp $1 Billion for 1 Milllion users.

    You shoudn't need to use a public model in order to answer a question like : "when can I withdraw from my retirement account ? "

    Google provides match to cost value that gives you ability to choose the right models for right jobs.

### Grounded in Factuality
    In an enterprise, it's important not just to provide an answer, but to prove where the answer came from,
    and what information was used to create the answer. This process ensures Grounded in Factuality.

### Easy to get started
    Google cloud provides a wide range of easy to use tools, including out-of-box search & conversation & quick access API's.
    This helps you to get started in days, rather than requiring you to learn the deep mathematics in GEN AI or
    tune a model to every possible question that could be asked. 
    Enterprise needs to manage mant models, user interfaces, data corpa & integrations with first & third-party data sources.

### Manageable at Scale
    Google Cloud provides a manageable at a scale platform that integartes into your existing user security, data management & entitlement workflow.
