The core building blocks of Generative AI (Gen AI) include: 
    neural networks, 
    machine learning (including deep learning), 
    and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) often playing a key role in processing sequential data like text or time series information. 

### Neural Networks:
    The foundational structure of most modern AI, where data is processed through interconnected layers of nodes, mimicking the human brain's neural pathways. 

### Machine Learning:
    A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming, allowing them to identify patterns and make predictions based on the information provided. 

### Deep Learning:
    A type of machine learning that uses multiple layers of neural networks to extract complex features from data, often used in advanced Gen AI applications. 

### GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks):
    A technique where two neural networks compete against each other - a generator creating new data and a discriminator evaluating its authenticity - leading to the generation of high-quality, realistic content. 

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
    A neural network architecture specifically designed to handle sequential data by remembering information from previous steps, making them useful for natural language processing and time series analysis. 

### Key points to remember:
    Data is crucial: Large amounts of high-quality data are essential to train Gen AI models effectively. 

    Model architecture: The specific design of the neural network architecture plays a significant role in determining the capabilities of a Gen AI model. 

    Training process: Fine-tuning the model through training with relevant data is critical for achieving desired outcomes. 

### Generative AI with Google
    Google brings Generative AI to orgnization by uniting Foundational Models with Vertex AI Agent Builder.
    Together they help you build transformative applications powered by your data.

      Images,                                                             Sentiment analysis
      Speech,                                                             information extraction
      Structured Data,                                                    image captioning
      3D signals                                                          Object recognition, Instruction Following
    ]                                                                   ]

    A foundation model is any model that is trained on a broad variety of data at scale, 
    and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks and applications, either by fine-tuning or using in-context learning.
    These models are the basis of many Generative AI products.

### Vertex AI Communication
    Vertex AI Conversation is a type of artificial intelligence that can simulate human conversation.
    It is made possible by Natural Language processing, a field of AI that allows computers to understand and process human language.
    With Vertex AI Conversation you can answer complex questions out-of-the-box and easily add transactional capabilities,such as 
            multi-turn conversations that build upon context, 
            and completing API transactions.
### Vertex AI Search
        It is an offering from Google Cloud that lets organizations quickly build generative AI powered search engines for customers and employees.
        Vertex AI Search enables you to get quality results out-of-the-box.And you can easily customize these results according to your business needs, such as responding to single independent queries with a lot of results, 
        and fine-grain control over results ranking.
