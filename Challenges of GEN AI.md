Google is boldly integrating AI into a huge range of products & highest standards of information integrity.
includes - Eductaion, research, & tools including online training courses such as guidebooks, research paper and Google product documents.

Generative AI has many challenges, including data privacy, bias, and computational costs. 
### Data privacy
### Data breaches 
    Large amounts of data used to train generative AI models can be vulnerable to unauthorized access and misuse. 
### Sensitive information
    Models can learn and reproduce sensitive information from training data, which can be compromised if shared. 
### Bias
    Perpetuating bias: If generative AI models are trained on biased data, they can perpetuate or magnify existing biases. 

### Harmful content
    Generative AI can be used to create fake news, deepfakes, and other types of false information. 

### Computational costs 
    Training and inference: Generative AI models can require a lot of computational power and resources, 
                             which can lead to increased costs and longer development times.

    Environmental impact: High energy consumption can have a significant environmental impact.

### Other challenges
    Scalability: As organizations increase their use of generative AI, they need to ensure that their solutions can scale 
                 and adapt without compromising efficiency, speed, or accuracy. 

    Data quality: The performance of generative AI models depends on the quality of training data. 

    Technical debt: If businesses don't see significant transformation from adopting generative AI, 
                    it could quickly join legacy systems as technical debt.
