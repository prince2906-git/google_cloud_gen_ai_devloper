### Generative AI Products offered by Google Cloud
    Google has two main types of Generative AI products, 
    >> consumer  
    >> enterprise products.
    
    Consumer Products such as Google AI Studio, previously known as Maker Suite, which is a browser-based IDE for prototyping with
    generative models, and the Gemini app, previously known as Bard, a chat application that answers user questions and assists them with tasks.

    With Gemini you can ask questions like “Help me plan a 3 day trip to Patagonia” and Gemini will generate a precise and informative answer based on a huge amount of data.
    Both the Gemini app and Google AI Studio are consumer products that use Gmail as the login, and the
    data that you submit when interacting with these products is owned by Google and used to improve the Gemini model.

    Additionally, the models used by the Gemini app and Google AI Studio are trained on large collections of data that may or 
    may not be compatible with what you want to do in an enterprise.
    
    Enterprise Products Vertex AI and Vertex AI Agent Builder cater to enterprises that need to control access to data.

### Why Enterprise Product is important ?   
    Several large organizations have shut off their employees’ access to consumer AI products because they were concerned about the questions their employees were asking and the information they were sharing.
    Using enterprise products gives you control of your data.The data is controlled and governed differently than the consumer-based products.
    You don’t want other organizations to know what data your LLMs are being trained on, or to have access to that data, or to know about the output.
    Fraud and security are really important: In regulated industries like banking or healthcare, it is necessary to prove HOW you provided an answer.
    Queries using enterprise data sources must be grounded in facts.
    As an enterprise customer, you also have the option to match the model size and characteristics to what you want to achieve.
    And, there’s Explainability and Responsible AI and other pieces built into it as part of the platform.
